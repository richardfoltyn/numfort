# DIERCKX #

DIERCKX is a package of Fortran subroutines for calculating smoothing splines for
various kinds of data and geometries, with automatic knot selection.
This library is also called FITPACK, but is independent of the FITPACK library by Alan Cline.

Includes modification from SciPy project (conversion to double precision).
